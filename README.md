 ## Individual differences in crowding as a predictor of visual search performance

Project to investigate the relationship between crowding and visual search

_Under Development_

This repository contains code used in a project performed at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam by Inês Veríssimo under the supervision of Chris Olivers

The experiment was run by resorting to python 2.7 and psychoLink (https://github.com/jonathanvanleeuwen/psychoLink)

The analysis scripts depend on python 3.6 and pyGazeAnalyser (https://github.com/esdalmaijer/PyGazeAnalyser.git)
